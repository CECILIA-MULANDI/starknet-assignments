HOW DOES STARKEX LEVERAGE STARK PROOFS TO ENSURE THE VALIDITY OF LARGE BATCHES OF TRANSACTIONS OFF-CHAIN WITH A MINIMAL ON-CHAIN FOOTPRINT?



-The off-chain Prover processes large batches of transactions and generates a STARK proof. 
-The on-chain Verifier checks the STARK proof in a few computational steps. 
-This enables massive scaling off-chain, where we process large computations whose integrity is then enforced on-chain with minimal computation.
